## Scala
The simulations in this book are written using functional programming in Scala. This choice is deliberate. Functional programming makes interpreting the semantics of the code transparent, making it easy to understand the relationship between computational-level theory and simulation. We provide an accessible introduction to basic functional programming in Scala.
