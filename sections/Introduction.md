# Introduction

Are you interested in psychology or cognitive science? Would you like to be able to make your own, formally precise, theoretical models? You have no prior training in theory and modeling? This book is a place to start!

# Approach

Under construction.

# Scala

The simulations in this book are written using functional programming in Scala.
This choice is deliberate. Functional programming makes interpreting the
semantics of the code transparent, making it easy to understand the relationship
between computational-level theory and simulation. We provide an accessible
introduction to basic functional programming in Scala.
